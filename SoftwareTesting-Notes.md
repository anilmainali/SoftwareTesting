#  Software Testing Notes:

## What is QA?
Q stands for quality and A stands for Assurance.

## Why Company needs QA?
Quality

## Importance of Software Testing/Objectives of Software Testing

- Finding defects which may get created by the programmer while developing the software.

- Gaining confidence in and providing information about the level of quality.

- To prevent defects.

- To make sure that the end result meets the business and user requirements.

- To ensure that it satisfies the BRS that is Business Requirement Specification and SRS that is System Requirement    Specifications.



## QA Types?
Different industry has different standards/requirements.
## QA Professionalism?
Knowledge
Experience

Tips: You have to elaborate the answer and tell in detail.

## QA ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

### 1. TOP MANAGEMENT

# Who does What?
- Understanding the business requirements - BA(Business Analyst)
- Converting business requirements into software requirements(SRS: Software requirements specifications / BRS: Business      requirements specifications)- BA(Business Analyst)
- Designing - Architect
- Development - Developer
- Testing - Tester


## SOFTWARE (SW) Development Model
- Waterfall
- Agile

## What is the role of a Tester?

- Understanding the requirement
- Implementing individual tests
- Setting up executing the tests
- Logging outcomes and verifying test execution
- Analyzing the results
- Reporting the bugs

## What is Manual Testing?
Manual testing is testing a product as a user or try to break the product as a user manually.

## Positive Testing 
When you are testing as a action as a regular user should. 

- Testing as it works as expected
- Testing a basic functionality
- What a regular user do on regular basis


## Negative Testng

This kind of testing is done when you try to break the system.
- Trying to break the system
- Try to cause an error
- Try to find some error message

## Common Terminology:
- Regression Test
- Smoke Test
- Black Box Tester
- White box Tester
- Grey Box Tester
- Test Case
- Use Case

## Black Box Testing
- No knowledge of code needed.
- No access to the source code.
- Use product as user and report.

Most manual QA start as Black Box Tester
Easiest way to start a career in QA

## White Box Testing
- Need knowledge of coding.
- Access to the source code.
- Dig in code and identify location of the bug.
- Time consuming.
- More salary.

## Grey Box Testing
- Somewhere in middle of Black and White box testing.
- Do manual testing.
- No access to the source code but know how components of the application work.
- Technical but not as technical as White Box Testing.

# Difference Between Defect/Error/Bug?

## Some Places to learn about Manual testing

- Guru99.com

## TEST CASE EXAMPLES
## Some of the tools which you can use to create Test Cases

- Test Links [FREE]
- TestRail[Premium]
- Bugzila[ FREE]


Look at the examples on how to write some test cases.  Practice Test cases.

## BASIC KNOWLEDGE FOR AUTOMATION

2 Categories for automation 
1. Testing [Test Cases]
2. Coding

2 Skills can be developed in Parallel
- Testing: Same as Manual testing , ability write test cases.
- Coding : Purely technical, writing proper code.

## Tips
- First lessons in coding have nothing to do with testing.
- Recommended to learn coding and manual testing at the same time.
- Find resources to learn manual testing.
- Choose a programming language and learn.
- Like a conventional school learn few subjects in parallel.
- coding is fun.
- when comfortable with test cases apply your coding knowledge to automate your test cases.

## HTML , JAVASCRIPT,XML

### HTML EXAMPLE

Few places to get your hands dirty;
- www.w3schools.com
- watch what is JavaScript on YouTube
- JavaScript makes pages interactive.
- Examples : Page content changing without refreshing , Hover Over a mouse an something happens, alert box
- Practice by creating 2 or 3 pages of your own.
- Automation is interacting with HTML.
- Basic HTML is a must for Selenium.

### XML
XML stands for extensible Markup Language

- used to carry data(transfer data)
- Information packaged in organized manner/matter
### Tutorial Resources:
- w3school.com
- youtube: Type: What is XML


## What is Static Testing?
- Code is not executed
- Manual review of code,documents to find the errors.
- Static techniques to find the causes of failures(defects)

## What are the beifits of Static Testing?
- Early defect detection.
- Development productivity
- Improvements
- Reduced Development time scales.
- Reduced testing cost and time, lifetime cost.
- Reductions,fewer defects and improved communitions.
- Defect Omissions
